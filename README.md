**Hello fellow game developer üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è!**

**I need less than 5 minutes of your precious time, feedback, and experience, to answer a few questions about multiplayer game development that will help me shape future projects. Survey is available at https://tally.so/r/w81Xr5 and requires no signup and no bs.**

A configurable and editable dungeon generator using Binary-Space Partitioning and hand-made rooms running in the browser.

## üïπÔ∏è Testing

A demo is available here https://halftheopposite.github.io/bsp-dungeon-generator.

## üíª Running

If you want to run the development mode to **generate** dungeons or **edit** rooms you can run the `yarn start` command.

This will launch the development server where you will be able to:

- Edit rooms at http://localhost:3000/#/edit/
- Generate dungeons at http://localhost:3000/#/generate/

## üìï Features

### Editor

Using the **edit** mode you can: create, edit, or remove the rooms that are used for generating dungeons. The current editing session is saved to the local storage which makes it possible to continue editing later on.

- You can **load** a `rooms.json` file to start with.
- You can **save** a `rooms.json` to use in your own project.

### Generator

In the **generate** mode, you can render dungeons by tuning some key parameters.

- You can **download** a JSON representation of the dungeon.
- You can **right click** and save the generated image.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Package (NPM)

The project also comes with a published package on NPM [@halftheopposite/dungeon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@halftheopposite/dungeon), which bundles the generator's code only. The interactive editor and generator are excluded for package's weight reasons.

How to use the generator's code in your own project:

```typescript
import { generate } from '@halftheopposite/dungeon';

const dungeon = generate({
  rooms: [...], // A list of templates (e.g. you can download the `rooms.json` from the online editor)
  mapWidth: 96,
  mapHeight: 56,
  mapGutterWidth: 1,
  iterations: 5,
  containerSplitRetries: 20,
  containerMinimumRatio: 0.45,
  containerMinimumSize: 4,
  corridorWidth: 2,
  seed: "dungeon",
});
```

This will return:

```typescript
const result = {
    width: number;
    height: number;
    tree: TreeNode<Container>;
    layers: {
        tiles: TileMap;
        props: TileMap;
        monsters: TileMap;
    };
}
```
